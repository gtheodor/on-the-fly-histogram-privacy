Code for paper "On-the-fly Privacy for Location Histograms," G. Theodorakopoulos, E. Panaousis, K. Liang and G. Loukas, IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing, 2020.

Running `python heuristics.py` should produce four `.txt` files, identical in names and contents to the four `*_results.txt` files in the repository.

The code is heavily commented. To understand it better, please read the paper above.
